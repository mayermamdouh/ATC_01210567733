# Event Booking System — Frontend

This is the frontend for a full-stack event booking web app. Users can browse events, book tickets, and admins can manage everything from an internal panel. It's built using **React.js** and **Vite**, with **Tailwind CSS**, **Material UI**, and supports multiple languages.

## Tech Stack

- **React + Vite** for fast frontend development
- **Tailwind CSS + MUI** for styling and UI components
- **React Router DOM v7** for routing
- **Axios** for API calls
- **i18next** for translation
- **jwt-decode** to handle user authentication
- **React Icons** for iconography
- **ESLint** to keep the code clean

---

## Main Features

### Authentication

- Users can sign up and log in
- Each user has a role (Admin or regular user)
- Authentication uses JWT stored on the client

### Home Page

- Otherwise, shows a "Book Now" button

### Event Details

- Users can book a ticket with one click
- Successful bookings redirect to a confirmation page

### Admin Panel
